### Developer Notes

I built this based on my past fights outcomes. I update this frequently with new fights, and I'd be glad to receive your data to improve the predictor's accuracy. Feel free to request new features !

Please send you fight screenshots at menigauxdamien@hotmail.fr :) (don't compress the images !)
